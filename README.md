# Object-Detection-Project
This is a project that we made with 3 other students from my Engineering school (ENSEEIHT). The goal was to detect objects on a pizza (and to detect if the pizza seems to be a good or not !)

# Execution
To use this project, just open the notebook on google-collab and follow the instructions
